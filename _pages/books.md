# Kidnapped and Afraid
This is a thriller that came to me one day when I was trying to start being serious about my writing. Honestly, I keep getting stuck with this one. Many scenes will just come to me, the difficulty lies in connecting those scenes and adding proper transitions. I do feel like it's an interesting story, one where even I am guessing at the ending.

## Description (needs to be edited)
I’m got kidnapped by a stranger who seems to enjoy feeding off of my fear. He won’t let me go but I’m free to escape just so he can drag me back again.

At first, I think he’s a psychopath, but then he starts doing things that seem impossible. Can he really read my mind? How does his eye color change so fast? Is he manipulating my emotions? Why doesn’t he seem to sleep? Why does he keep me imprisoned? Nothing makes sense and the more I dig the more confusing it gets.

He’s not a vampire. He’s not affected by blood, has no problem stalking me during the daylight, and lacks the fangs. He isn’t fae, no pointy ears. He can’t possibly be a werewolf, full moons have come and gone with no change. So, what is he? An alien? Who is he? And how will I finally escape him? Will I ever escape him?

# Test My Fire
I started writing this and *Kidnapped and Afraid* on the same day. They are very similiar in genre, however, this one is more of a mystery than a thriller. 

## Description
(Her)

He killed my parents, not to mention dozens of other people. He’s only known by the Phantom but I will uncover his identity and make him pay. I’m good at this game and I’ll play it till I die. The Phantom thinks he’s good, but he hasn’t met me yet. I play with fire, live in it really. That’s why I’m called the Phoenix Fox. The fire may burn me, but I will extinguish it before it can kill me.

(Him)

Yes, I’m a killer and I’m good at it. Hundreds have tried to find me, none have succeeded and that’s the way I like it. I wasn’t named “The Phantom’’ for nothing. Those who have gotten close I’ve gotten rid of, all except the cunning little spy known as the Phoenix Fox. She was at my brother’s party and now she’s in my head. I should kill her, I really should. She’s gotten too close and she knows it. She keeps toying with me, jumping in and out of the crossfire. She’s good at the game, but I’m better. The clock is ticking and I’m good at waiting. I know she’ll come to me, they always do. And when she does, I’ll take care of her too. Here little fox, come test my fire.

# Dear Diary, Do You Wanna Know A Secret?
This is hands-down my favorite manuscript right now. It is so fun to write and the words just flow from my head onto my paper. It is a clean romance story and I think it will be a novella (little novel; longer than a short story and the plot and characters are a bit more detailed/developed).

## Description
All Sasha wanted to do was finish school, get a job she loved, get married, and start a family. Unfortunately, getting past school seems impossible. Between staying on track with her studies and keeping up with her other activities, graduation couldn’t be farther away. But then the Stone’s show up.

Caden Stone is... hot. That’s the only way Sasha can describe him without sounding like an idiot. He’s just the guy she should avoid, one that likes trouble. Avoiding him isn’t that hard, even though he watches her every day and makes her skin crawl. Yeah, avoiding Caden would be a great idea if she wanted to keep her virginity. Too bad Jennifer, Caden’s half-sister, has other plans.

Jennifer Stone is that blond brat that everyone has met at least once and either befriends her immediately or loathes her forever. She wasn’t really a problem until she decided she wanted to uncover all of Sasha’s past and reveal every little secret, and that’s ignoring the fact that she seems to want to hook Sasha up with Caden for God knows why.

Sasha has a lot of secrets and they’re kept that way for very good reasons. Those secrets can kill and there are people who would kill for them. If Sasha doesn’t stop Jennifer, there’s going to be a war and the whole town might get destroyed in the crossfire.

Do you wanna know a secret? Because I’ve got a big one and it just may get me in a whole lot of trouble. If it doesn’t kill me first.

# Past Nightmares. Present Ghosts. Future Fears.
It is a short story and will probably be finished before all the others. 
It is part of a new plan I'm trying out, basically, writing one or two short stories a month. I hear it's good practice and helps exercise your imagination. 
I have heard it said many times and I do believe that short stories are a good way to start your writing journey. Perhaps, that's why I'm having trouble with my other stories...

## Description
Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings has been working with the Boise Police Departmentfor six years and has dealt with many cases, but this one seems a bit off. 

Robert Johnson has worked in the police department for twelve years and has seen his fair share of murders, gangs, and suicides. He moved to Idaho and joined the BPD for a more quieter life in the job he enjoys.

Zipporah Crusoe is tired of running around the country to escape her past ghosts and Boise, Idaho looks like the perfect place to finally settle down and enjoy life. Unfortunately, ghosts always return to haunt you until they're put to rest and she has some big and scary ones.

Together, the three get tangled up in kidnappings, murders, and political scandals that all seem to be dangerously connected. Someone, somewhere, is using them to reveal secrets that have been laid down for years and are tangled in ways that effects the whole city, and maybe even the entire country. The keys to unlock and untangle all of them lie in Zipporah Crusoe's past and connections, if she has the courage to face those ghosts and find them.

### Case I: The New Years' Eve Lamb
Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings is asked for his help in a peculiar case about a missing women. What's peculiar about? Well, everything. Cassidy Williams is the happily married wife of Greg Williams, or so it seemed until she disappeared without a trace one morning while her husband was at work. She didn't take anything or leave a note, she never hinted there was something wrong, she just up and left. Officer Robert Johnson thinks it's just another runaway wife case but Clemmings thinks otherwise, runaways don't leave all their things and valuables when they leave. The husband is convinced that Cassidy didn't leave him and that she was kidnapped, but theirs no evidence to back up his claim. With no leads and complete confusion, Jared reaches out to a friend who has a knack for finding "invisible" leads.

Zipporah Crusoe has never been too busy to help Jared, her life is very quiet as it is, though when he tells her about this new case something from her past resurfaces. Zipporah isn't sure if her nightmares are truly connected to this case, but if they are, Cassidy Williams may be on her way to death by fire unless Zipporah can figure it out before the sun sets on December 31.

**Objective:** Find Cassidy Williams
**Countdown:** 7 days

### Case II: Tag, You're It (WIP)
Zipporah Crusoe is scared but determined not to be swallowed up in her nightmares. When one of them shows up in Sunset looking for her, she fights the urge to run and instead stands her ground. It's a lot easier with Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings and the whole Boise Police Department looking out for her. However, Rowan Arturek won't just leave Boise without some answers and Zipporah knows she can't avoid him forever; but when people go missing and end up dead, she begins to question if Rowan is here for a bigger reason than just getting back his woman.

Homicide Detective Jared Clemmings knew Zipporah had a rocky pastbut he had no idea it included people like Rowan Arturek. The Arturek Corporation has been suspected of being involved in shady businesses from the start and Jared doesn't want to believe that the sarcastic and witty aphonic woman he's starting to get attatched to could have anything to do with them. When murder cases start piling up on his desk, Detective Clemmings finds it a bit difficult not to suspect Arturek and Arturek continues to make it even more difficult by refusing to give straight answers to Clemmings' questioning.

In her heart, Zipporah doesn't want to believe that the man she once loved would be the killer behind the murders that resemble her nightmares, but she does know what he is capable of and it still haunts her. Together, her and Jared need to stop the serial killer who has a taste for brutalizing his victims, whether the killer is Arturek or not.

**Objective:** Stop the Killer
