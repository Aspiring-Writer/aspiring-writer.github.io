# Greetings

I am a young, Christian writer who is still trying to complete college. I love to read and write fiction stories in my spare time. Some Christian aspects will show up in my writing so do not be surprised. Most of my inspiration is God-given, I'm not sure how else to explain it. I have been writing since I was in my mid-teens (not so long ago), however, I have just recently become more dedicated to writing and publishing my work. I am very social and very fond of feedback, so please do leave comments on any of my posts.
