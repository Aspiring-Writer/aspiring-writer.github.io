      <h3>Yoela Olson</h3>
      <p>I'm a homeschooled, Christian student who is struggling to stay motivated and finish things.</p>

      <p>I love Jesus, DIYing (crochet, knitting, macrame, paracord, been there done that), reading, writing (I'm currently writing three stories), horses, and anything Linux (I'm not a complete tech geek but I definitely see myself getting there).</p>

      <p>I'm very social, which isn't a very good thing since I trust people too easily wink, but I'm getting better. I open my mouth a lot before thinking, but as I said, I'm getting better. I procrastinate way too much but prayerfully I will learn some self-control and apply it everywhere in my life (starting with my mouthðŸ˜‹).</p>

      <p>If you're one of those people who know this stuff, my Enneagram number is Seven and my personality type is Campaigner.</p>
